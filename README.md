# SenseHat_Sparkle_Scratch
Use Scratch to control the SenseHat

Inspired by version done by Matt Sendorek https://twitter.com/matt_sendorek and by Raspberry Pi Foundation Python version

Scratch 1.4 and Scratch 2.0 versions

Uses Scratch to colour random dots on the SenseHat with random colours

This version included keyboard control to change the amount of red, green, blue in the colours.

Scratch 2.0 is easier to control the Sense Hat with as the custom extension provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation makes it easier to set a single pixel.

Instead of needed the 'command' with the broadbast, it is a single line of code that is much easier to read.

NOTE: Scratch 2.0 version should work with the Sense Hat Emulator.
Scratch 1.4 only works with the physical Sense Hat.
